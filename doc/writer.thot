====== Writer Manual ======

This chapter is aimed to writer of documents in @(THOT). You will find
here the details to benefit from the power of @(THOT).


===== Basic Syntax =====

This sections describes the minimal @(THOT) syntax that is independent
of any module.


==== Comments ====

@(THOT) supports comments spanning on a complete line. You just have to
use double ''@'' at the start of the line (notice that most wiki
independent syntax is prefixed by ''@'').

<code>
@@ a commend here to the end of the line
</code>

The comment is just for author information and disappears in the final
output document.


==== Definitions and Variables ====

To share information information and to configure modules, @(THOT)
provides a system of variables. A variable is defined by its name
and its textual value.

To define a variable, you have just to type:
<code>
@IDENTIFIER=VALUE
</code>
Where ''IDENTIFIER'' is the variable identifier and ''VALUE'' the value
of the variable. This value may be any text (including module tags)
to the end of the line (without including the final newline).

To use a variable, you have just to type anywhere in the text and in
a line.
<code>
TEXT-BEFORE @(IDENTIFIER) TEXT-AFTER
</code>
Where ''IDENTIFIER'' is the identifier of the variable to get the value
from. ''TEXT-BEFORE'' and ''TEXT-AFTER'' are any text (possibly
containing markup or variable use.

In the example below, we define a variable ''THOT'' that is used
throughout this document and avoid to type boring markup:
<code>
@THOT=**//THOT//**

This document presents @(THOT), a textual document process. @(THOT)
...
</code>

Notice that the value of a variable may contains variable uses but
they are processed in late evaluation: they are replaced by their value
only  when the variable is used in
the main text. For example, the @(THOT) text below:
<code>
@X=--@(Y)--
@Y=hello
@(X) World !
@Y=bye, bye
@(X) World !
</code>
will give:
<code>
hello World !
bybe, bye World !
</code>


==== Default Variables ====

As seen in the previous section, variables may be used to generate
document content but they are also largely used to configure the
behaviour of the different components of @(THOT) or to provide
automatic information to the writer. This section
describe the standard variables used by @(THOT).

The table shows all variables that may be provided to @(THOT):

^ Variable ^Usage ^
| ''AUTHORS'' |List of authors (including email and separated by comma). |
| ''ENCODING'' |Character set encoding (as defined by IANA)((if not given, current character set is assumed.)). |
| ''LANG'' |Language of the document (as in Unix locale). |
| ''OUTPUT'' |Used by some back-end to precise output (pdf for example) |
| ''TITLE'' |Title of the generated document. |
| ''VERSION'' |Version of the document |

The variable below are provided by @(THOT) but must not be changed
(unless you know exactly what you do):
^ Variable ^Content ^
| ''THOT_BASE'' |Base directory of @(THOT)((It may be used to retrieve resources provided by @(THOT) like CSS stylesheets.)). |
| ''THOT_DATE'' |Current date. |
| ''THOT_FILE'' |Start file containing the @(THOT) text (as passed in command line). |
| ''THOT_OUT_PATH'' |Path of the file to generate (as passed to ''-o'' option). |
| ''THOT_OUT_TYPE'' |Type of output back-end (as passed to ''-t'' option). |
| ''THOT_USE_PATH'' |Colon-separated list of directory containing modules. |
| ''THOT_VERSION'' |Current version of @(THOT) |

There exist other variables according to used modules or back-end
that may be found in their documentation.


==== Module Usage ====

As shown in the tutorial example, a	proeminent feature of @(THOT) is
the configuration of the text scanner according needs of the user.
This is mainly performed by the use of specific modules that add
syntax to the basic parser of @(THOT). To use a module, you have
just to add the following syntax:
<code>
@use MODULE_NAME
</code>

The module use is usually performed at the start of the document but
it is not mandatory. The module is retrieved from the paths found
in the ''THOT_USE_PATH'' variable (separated by colons). This variable
is initialized with the path ''$(THOT_BASE)/mods''.

Notice that, when you include a front-end module, like ''dokuwiki'',
syntax from the previous front-end module are removed but other
syntax rules are kept.


==== Inclusion ====

@(THOT) allows to split big document in multiple files. Then, one has
to re-assemble the document using inclusion in the main document. The
inclusion is performed in textual way as if the included text was
replacing the inclusion command.

An inclusion command has the following syntax:
<code>
@include PATH_TO_FILE_TO_INCLUDE
</code>

The passed path may be absolute or relative. In the latter case, the
absolute path is built from the path of the directory containing the
main file. This ensures that the document is well built whatever the
working directory of @(THOT) invocation.


==== Assigning a label to an embedded part ====

In Thot terminology, an embedded part is a piece of document that is
not part of the main flow of text. Usual embedded parts are figures,
tables, listing, etc.

Label may hooked to embedded in a standard way using the ''@label''
syntax. The label is formed by any word and formatting following
the ''@label'' keyword to the end of the file. It must be placed
just after the embedded part as in the example below.

<file>
  <code c>
  int main() {
    return 0;
  }
  </code>
  @label This is //my// listing
</file>

==== Command ====

The ''thot'' command supports the syntax below:
<code sh>
> thot MAIN_FILE OPTIONS
</code>

The //MAIN_FILE// is @(THOT) file matching the syntax described in
this chapter. The //OPTIONS// are described below:
  * ''-h'', ''--help'': display the help of the command ;
  * ''-o'', ''--out'' //FILE//: select the output file ;
  * ''-D'', ''--define'' //NAME//''=''//VALUE'': defines a variable with its value ;
  * ''-t'', ''--type'' //TYPE//: define the type of chosen back-end
(default value ''html'', or one of ''docbook'' and ''latex'').


===== Modules =====

This section describes the main modules and back-end provided by
@(THOT).

==== Dokuwiki Front-end ====

The dokuwiki module is a basic front-end providing the dokuwiki syntax.
Please refer [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/syntax|Dokuwiki Syntax]] for more details.

Usually, this module must be included at the head of the file
containing dokuwiki syntax:
<code>
@use dokuwiki
</code>

In addition, the dokuwiki module provides a syntax for definition list
(notice the two spaces before the question mark):
<code>
  ? term 1 : definition 1
  ? term 2 : definition 2
  ? term 3 : multiline definition
And there ?
And here !
</code>

That gives:
----
  ? term 1 : definition 1
  ? term 2 : definition 2
  ? term 3 : multiline definition
And there ?
And here !
----


==== Dot Module ====

The dot module allows to use [[http://www.graphviz.org/|GraphViz]] graph drawing inside @(THOT).

Include the module with:
<code>
@use dot
</code>

The dot graph insertion must implements the syntax below:
<code>
@<dot DRAWER>
DOT syntax
@</dot>
</code>

The //DOT syntax// must follows the rules of ''.dot''. See
[[http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html|DOT language]] for more details.

The //DRAWER// is optional or may be one of the following with the matching effect:
  * dot -- directed graphs (default)
  * neato -- undirected graphs
  * twopi -- radial layouts of graphs
  * circo -- circular layout of graphs
  * fdp -- undirected graphs

==== latexmath Module ====

This module, to be used, must be imported as below:
<code>
@use latexmath
</code>
@use latexmath

In this case, Latex math expressions may be inserted in the text between
dollars as in the example below:
<code>
This is an equation: $\LARGE e^x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!}$.
</code>
That will produce:

This is an equation: $\LARGE e^x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!}$.


Short guide to this syntax may be found [[ftp://ftp.ams.org/ams/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf|here]].

To have a lonely dollar, just put a double dollar, ''$$''.





===== Back-ends =====

@(THOT) supports several output back-ends whose work is described here.

==== HTML Back-end ====

This back-end is maybe the more used one as it only requires a web
brower to use the documentation. It is usually called by passing the
option ''-t html'' to the @(THOT) invocation.

This back-end may be configured using different variables as presented
below.

^ Variable ^ Value ^Description ^
| ''HTML_STYLES'' | CSS file path | use the given CSS in the generated file |
| ''HTML_SHORT_ICON'' | image file path | short icon for HTML file |
| ''HTML_ONE_FILE_PER'' | document, chapter, section | generation structure: one file per ... |

Whatever the option, this back-end creates two things whose name
is based on a ROOT name. It may be either the original @(THOT) path without suffix,
or the ''THOT_OUT_PATH'' path.
  * ''ROOT.html'' -- the entry page of the documentation
  * ''ROOT-n.html'' -- page n of the documentation
  * ''ROOT-imports/'' -- contains all file used from the entry page (other pages, images, CSS, etc)

So to copy the result documentation, you have just to move these files
and directories to your target directory.

The back-end supports CSS stylesheet. To get your own stylesheet,
you have just to provide styles matching the tags generated by this
back-end. The tables below sum-up these tags.

Text items:
^ Tag ^ @(THOT) Item ^
| ''<b> ... </b>'' | bold area |
| ''<i> ... </i>'' | italic area |
| ''<u> ... </u>'' | underline area |
| ''<sub> ... </sub>'' | subscript area |
| ''<sup> ... </sup>'' | superscript area |
| ''<tt> ... </tt>'' | monospace area |
| ''<s> ... </s>'' | deleted area |
| ''<a ...> ... </a>'' | link |
| ''<img ...> ... </img> | embedded image |

Paragraphs:
^ Tag ^ @(THOT) Item ^
| ''<hn> ... </hn>'' | header of level n |
| ''<blockquote> ... </blockquote>'' | quote paragraph |
| ''<hr/>'' | horizontal rule |
| ''<p> ... </p>'' | paragraph |
| ''<ul> ... </ul>'' | unnummbered list |
| ''<ol> ... </ol>'' | numbered list |
| ''<li> ... </li>'' | list item |
| ''<div class="listing"> ... </div>'' | embedded listing |

Structural items:
^ Tag ^ @(THOT) Item ^
| ''<div class="body"> ... </div>'' | main part of the page |
| ''<ul class="toc"> ... </ul>'' | content table |


Tables:
^ Tag ^ @(THOT) Item ^
| ''<table> ... </table>'' | table |
| ''<tr> ... </tr>'' | table row |
| ''<td> ... </td>'' | table cell |
| ''<th> ... </th>'' | table header cell |

Foot notes:
^ Tag ^ @(THOT) Item ^
| ''<a class="footnumber" ...> ... </a>'' | foot note reference |
| ''<div class="footnotes"> ... </div>'' | foot note part |
| ''<p class="footnote"> ... </p>'' | foot note entry |
| ''<a class="footnumber" ...> ... </a>'' | foot note number |


The header of the page have the following structure:
<code html>
<div class="header">
	<div class="title"> TITLE </div>
	<div class="authors"
		<a href="mailto:AUTHOR_MAIL"> AUTHOR_NAME </a>
		...
	</div>
</div>
</code>


==== Latex Back-end ====

The Latex back-end produces output as lonely Latex file that may be
compiled to produces PDF output.

The following variables may be used to control the generation process:

^ Variable ^ Description ^
| OUTPUT | ''latex'' for simple Latex generation, ''pdf'' for also generating PDF. |
| LATEX_CLASS | Select the class of generated document (''book'' as a default). |
| LATEX_PREAMBLE | The variable value is appended as-is just after class definition (it may be used to included specific Latex modules) |
| LATEX_PAPER | Select the paper type of the generated document (''a4paper'' as a default). |



==== DocBook Back-end ====

This back-end generates [[http://www.docbook.org/|DockBook]] XML format.

The following variables may be used to control the generation process:

^ Variable ^ Description ^
| DOCBOOK_BACKEND | one of ''openjade'' (default) or ''dblatex''((This may depends on the software installed of your OS))|
